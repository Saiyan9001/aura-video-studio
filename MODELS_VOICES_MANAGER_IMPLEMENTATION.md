# Models & Voices Manager Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive Models & Voices Manager to Aura Video Studio, allowing users to:
- View and manage Stable Diffusion models (base, refiner, VAE, LoRA)
- View and manage TTS voices (Piper, Mimic3)
- Install models from built-in catalogs
- Attach external folders to use existing model/voice collections
- Verify checksums and view model metadata
- Open folders directly from UI
- See exact file paths for all models and voices

## Architecture

### Backend (C#/.NET)

#### Core Components

**Aura.Core/Downloads/ModelInstaller.cs**
- `ManagedModel` class: Represents a model or voice with metadata
- `ModelKind` enum: SD_BASE, SD_REFINER, VAE, LORA, PIPER_VOICE, MIMIC3_VOICE
- `ExternalDirectoryConfig`: Configuration for external model directories
- Core operations:
  - `GetModelsAsync()`: List all models of a specific kind
  - `InstallAsync()`: Download and install models with checksum verification
  - `AddExternalDirectoryAsync()`: Index models from external folders
  - `RemoveAsync()`: Delete model files (with read-only protection)
  - `VerifyAsync()`: Verify model checksums
  - `DiscoverModelsInDirectoryAsync()`: Scan directories for models

**Default Installation Paths:**
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Aura\Tools\
├── stable-diffusion-webui\models\
│   ├── Stable-diffusion\  (Base & Refiner)
│   ├── VAE\
│   └── Lora\
├── piper\voices\
└── mimic3\voices\
```

#### API Layer

**Aura.Api/Controllers/ModelsController.cs**

Seven REST endpoints:

1. **GET /api/models/list**
   - Query params: `engineId`, `kind`
   - Returns: List of models with file paths, sizes, verification status

2. **POST /api/models/install**
   - Body: `{ id, name, kind, sizeBytes, sha256, mirrors[], destinationPath }`
   - Downloads model from mirrors with retry logic
   - Verifies checksum if provided

3. **POST /api/models/add-external**
   - Body: `{ kind, folderPath, isReadOnly }`
   - Indexes existing models in external directory
   - No files are moved or copied

4. **POST /api/models/remove**
   - Body: `{ modelId, filePath }`
   - Deletes model file
   - Prevents removal from read-only external directories

5. **POST /api/models/verify**
   - Body: `{ filePath, expectedSha256 }`
   - Returns: `{ isValid, status, actualSha256, issues[] }`

6. **POST /api/models/open-folder**
   - Body: `{ filePath }`
   - Opens file explorer to model location
   - Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)

7. **GET /api/models/external-directories**
   - Returns: List of configured external directories

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

#### Components

**Aura.Web/src/components/Engines/ModelManager.tsx**

Dialog component that provides:
- Table view of all models with:
  - Name, Type (Base/VAE/LoRA/Voice), Size, Status
  - External badge for models from external folders
  - Action menu (Open Folder, Verify, Remove)
- Model details panel showing:
  - Full file path
  - Provenance (source)
  - SHA256 checksum
- External folder management:
  - Input field for folder path
  - "Add Folder" button
  - List of configured external directories

**Aura.Web/src/components/Engines/EngineCard.tsx**

Updated to include:
- "Models & Voices" button (appears when engine is installed)
- Opens ModelManager dialog for the specific engine
- Icon: DocumentFolder24Regular

### Tests

**Aura.Tests/ModelInstallerTests.cs**

13 unit tests covering:
1. ✅ Discover models in default directory
2. ✅ Discover Piper voices
3. ✅ Index external models
4. ✅ Throw error for non-existent directory
5. ✅ Return both default and external models
6. ✅ Delete model file
7. ✅ Prevent deletion from read-only external directory
8. ✅ Verify valid checksum
9. ✅ Detect invalid checksum
10. ✅ Handle unknown checksum (user-supplied)
11. ✅ List external directories
12. ✅ Remove external directory configuration
13. ✅ Filter models by kind

**Test Results:** All 513 tests passing (including 13 new tests)

## Documentation

### Updated Files

**docs/ENGINES_SD.md**
- Added "Models & Voices Manager" section
- Documented path conventions
- Instructions for using external model collections
- Benefits of external folders (no duplication, keep organization)

**docs/TTS_LOCAL.md**
- Added voice storage location
- Documented Models & Voices Manager for voices
- Instructions for using external voice collections
- Path conventions for Piper and Mimic3

## Usage Examples

### View Installed Models

1. Open Download Center
2. Navigate to Engines tab
3. Click Stable Diffusion or Piper card
4. Click "Models & Voices" button
5. View all installed models with file paths

### Add External Model Folder

1. Open Models & Voices Manager
2. Enter folder path: `D:\MyModels\StableDiffusion`
3. Click "Add Folder"
4. Models are indexed immediately
5. No files are moved or copied

### Verify Model Checksum

1. Open Models & Voices Manager
2. Find model in table
3. Click "..." menu → "Verify"
4. See verification result with checksum details

### Open Model Folder

1. Open Models & Voices Manager
2. Find model in table
3. Click "..." menu → "Open Folder"
4. File explorer opens to model location

## Benefits

### For Users

1. **Transparency**: See exactly where files are stored
2. **No Duplication**: Use existing model collections without copying
3. **Organization**: Keep your own folder structure
4. **Verification**: Ensure model integrity with checksums
5. **Easy Access**: Open folders directly from UI
6. **Flexibility**: Mix default and external models

### For Developers

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns (Core/API/UI)
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new model kinds
3. **Testability**: Full unit test coverage
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS

## Technical Details

### Model Discovery

Models are discovered by file extension:
- SD Models: `*.safetensors`, `*.ckpt`, `*.pt`
- Voices: `*.onnx` (requires matching `.onnx.json` for Piper)

### External Folder Handling

- Folders can be marked as read-only (default) or read/write
- Read-only folders prevent accidental deletion
- Changes to external folders are reflected immediately
- No background syncing required

### Checksum Verification

- Uses SHA256 algorithm
- Optional (models without checksums show "Unknown checksum (user-supplied)")
- Results cached for performance
- Full verification on demand

### Path Storage

- External paths stored in Aura configuration
- Absolute paths used (no symbolic links)
- Configuration persists across sessions
- Paths validated on startup

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not in scope for this PR):

1. **Model Installation UI**: Browse and install from built-in catalog
2. **Voice Samples**: Play voice samples in UI
3. **Model Metadata**: Display additional model information
4. **Batch Operations**: Install/remove multiple models at once
5. **Search/Filter**: Find models quickly in large collections
6. **Model Tags**: Organize models with custom tags
7. **Usage Tracking**: See which models are most used
